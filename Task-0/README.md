# Deep-into-CNNs-Task

This repository contains a simple implementation of logistic regression and gradient descent. In the notebook, I have also implemented **AdaGrad** and **RMSprop** gradient descent. 

I do also have an implementation of a character-level RNN model that generates random dinosaur names using a given dataset of dinosaur names.
